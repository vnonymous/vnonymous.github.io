I live in Iwakuni, Japan.

I love to travel to various places, and photography is one of my favorite hobbies.

Note that this is not my photo, but my friend's, who was able to capture what Iwakuni has to offer. Luckily, she shared the photo with me, and here it is: ![RT.](Sakura.jpg)


Any input is greatly appreciated, so here is a link to some of my other finished work: [Sakura.](https://vsco.co/jaeosama/images/1)
